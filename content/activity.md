## What we do

We regularly meet up for discussions and workshops. we are organizing book clubs, lectures, and discussion groups. All meetings are open to the public and you can see an overview in the calendar at the bottom of this page.

### Discussion groups

Every thursday we meet up at HÃ¸yteknologisenteret for our discussion group we are hosting. In these discussion groups, we go through AI Safety concepts and problems. For the moment we are going through a "course" in mechanistic interpretability. Besides that, we are also discussing generally interesting topics in AI safety.
