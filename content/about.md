AI Safety Bergen is a local chapter of AI Safety Collab dedicated to addressing one of the most pressing challenges of our time: ensuring the safe and beneficial development of artificial intelligence.

As part of the global AI Safety movement, we focus on the unique opportunities and challenges presented by AI in Bergen and the surrounding region.Our organization brings together a diverse group of researchers, professionals, students, and concerned citizens who share a common goal: to contribute to the responsible advancement of AI technology. 

We believe that as AI systems become increasingly powerful and influential in our society, it's crucial to work proactively to align these systems with human values and interests. At AI Safety Bergen, we organize regular meetups, workshops, and lectures to explore key topics in AI safety, such as technical alignment, value alignment, AI governance, and the potential long-term impacts of advanced AI systems. These events provide a platform for learning, discussion, and collaboration among members and invited experts.

Whether you're an AI researcher, a student interested in technology ethics, or simply a concerned citizen, AI Safety Bergen offers a welcoming community to explore these critical issues. Join us in our mission to shape the future of AI in Bergen and beyond, ensuring that as we harness the power of artificial intelligence, we do so in a way that is safe, ethical, and aligned with human values.
