## Mission Statement

As AI systems grow increasingly powerful and widespread, they bring potentially catastrophic risks for humanity. We believe it is essential to work proactively to ensure these systems remain safe and aligned with human values and interests.

In the last decade—particularly the last 5 years—AI capabilities have evolved at a breathtaking pace. Yet the science of steering, interpreting, and controlling these systems has not kept pace. We cannot predict precisely when AI will develop the concerning capabilities that could pose existential risks. This uncertainty, combined with rapid advancement, creates a precarious situation demanding urgent, thoughtful and decisive action.

## Who are we?

AI Safety Norway is a dedicated Norwegian non-profit organization working to ensure that transformative AI ultimately benefits humanity. We operate across three key areas:

- **Research**: We focus particularly on interpretability—developing methods to understand what's happening inside AI systems and how they make decisions.
- **Outreach**: We educate the public, researchers, and industry about AI safety challenges and solutions through workshops, seminars, and publications.
- **Policy Advocacy**: We work with policymakers to develop regulations and frameworks that promote responsible AI development.
